Q. Your task is to take two numbers of int data type, two numbers of float data type as input and output their sum:

  1) Declare 4 variables: two of type int and two of type float.
  2) Read 2 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the 'Input Format' section below) and initialize your 4 variables.
  3) Use the + and - operator to perform the following operations:
      a) Print the sum and difference of two int variable on a new line.
      b) Print the sum and difference of two float variable rounded to one decimal place on a new line.

Input Format

The first line contains two integers.
The second line contains two floating point numbers.

Output Format

Print the sum and difference of both integers separated by a space on the first line, and the sum and difference of both float (scaled to 1 decimal place) separated by a space on the second line.


Sample Input

10 4
4.0 2.0


Sample Output

14 6
6.0 2.0

Answer:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
	int a,b,t,m;
    float c,z,g,h;
    
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    scanf("%f %f", &c, &z);
    
    t = a + b;
    m = a - b;
    
    g = c + z;
    h = c - z;
    
    
    printf("%d %d \n", t, m);
    printf("%.1f %.1f", g, h);

    
    return 0;
}
